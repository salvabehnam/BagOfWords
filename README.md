# 📝 Bag of Words Text Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to convert text data into a **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** representation using tokenization and count vectorization. It also covers basic data cleaning steps and potential model training or analysis.

## 📌 Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing special characters, and standardizing text.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
- **Count Vectorization**: Converting tokens into a matrix of token counts.
- **Potential Model Training**: Laying the groundwork for training machine learning models on the vectorized data.
